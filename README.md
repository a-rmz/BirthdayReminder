# BirthdayReminder

What it does (so far):
* Shows you the birth date.
* Shows you the age (if a year is provided) in a special screen.

What it does not (yet):
* Notifies you if today's somebody's birthday.
* Allows you to send them a message.
* Allows you to see the contact's picture in detail.
* (BONUS) Rule the world.
